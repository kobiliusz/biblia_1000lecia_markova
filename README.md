* Install python3 interpreter (depends on your system)
* In python shell type:
** pip3 install markovify
** python3 markov.py > proroctwo.txt
* If that doesn't work try:
** pip install markovify
** python markov.py > proroctwo.txt
* The file "proroctwo.txt" now should contain the prophecy for the end of the world
* If it doesn't, you are not worthy of knowing the prophecy.
